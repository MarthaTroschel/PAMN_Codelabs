# PAMN_Codelabs

## Project Context
This repository contains solutions for several Android Codelabs completed as part of the *Native Mobile Applications Programming* course.  
All exercises were implemented in **IntelliJ IDEA with the Android plugin**, because other IDE setups (such as Android Studio) did not work reliably in my environment. IntelliJ allowed me to configure Gradle, Jetpack Compose, and Kotlin seamlessly for these tasks.

---

## Codelab 1: Comienza a usar Android
**Key Learnings:**
- Learned how to run basic Kotlin code.
- Used `println()` to display text in the console.
- Understood the Android project structure.

---

## Codelab 2: Primera App
**Key Learnings:**
- Built a first interactive app with buttons and text fields.
- Implemented event handling using `setOnClickListener`.
- Learned how to manage state and update UI dynamically.

---

## Codelab 3: Jetpack Compose Basics
**Key Learnings:**
- Transitioned from XML-based layouts to declarative UI with Jetpack Compose.
- Learned about Composable functions and the `@Composable` annotation.
- Explored layout modifiers and Material Design components in Compose.

---

## Codelab 4: Jetpack Compose Advanced
**Key Learnings:**
- Implemented more complex UI structures using `Scaffold` and `TopAppBar`.
- Learned about state management with `remember` and `mutableStateOf`.
- Applied Material3 components and understood experimental API opt-in.

---

## Codelab 5: Modern Android App Architecture
**Key Learnings:**
- Implemented MVVM architecture using `ViewModel`, `Repository`, and `StateFlow`.
- Learned how to integrate Jetpack Compose with lifecycle-aware components.
- Explored best practices for structuring scalable Android apps.

---

## Interesting Aspects
- Setting up **IntelliJ IDEA with Android plugin** was challenging but provided a lightweight alternative to Android Studio.
- Managing **Gradle dependencies for Compose and Lifecycle** required precise versions to avoid unresolved references.
- Opting into **experimental Material3 APIs** highlighted how Android evolves and why developers must handle API stability.
- Implementing **MVVM with StateFlow** in Compose demonstrated the importance of reactive state management for modern UI.
